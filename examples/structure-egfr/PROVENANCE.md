# EGFR drug binding contacts: provenance

This directory contains the community preset for **Structural biology and drug discovery**, focused on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR, UniProt **P00533**, 1,210 aa).

It visualizes co-crystal drug binding contacts for 7 clinically approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and 1 reference ATP analogue across solved PDB structures, contextualized with PDB structure coverage, AlphaFold2 model confidence, domain topology, and catalytic sites.

## Coordinate Mapping
All coordinates are mapped to canonical human EGFR (P00533-1, 1,210 amino acids) using SIFTS (Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequence). PDB author residue numbers (which often count from the mature peptide after signal peptide cleavage, e.g. L858R as L834R) are mapped strictly to canonical UniProt sequence indices.
